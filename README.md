# Front-End

We used React as the front end and used react-router-dom to render
our pages and components dynamically

Our brander colors are #ff79df (pink), #ffaf4f (orange), #fff74f (yellow)

# Back-End

We used Flask to set up the backend and SQLAlechmy to set up and query to 
the database. We also are using a SQLite Database
